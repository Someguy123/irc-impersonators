# IRC Impersonators
Recently there has been an invasion of nick impersonators, for example cob1ee impersonating coblee (notice the number one instead of an L). 

This page will show you different ways your nick could be impersonated. 

On Freenode you can simply change your nick to one of them, and type /msg nickserv group while logged into your primary nickname, and this will prevent the impersonators from using them (assuming you have ENFORCE turned on).

Simply enter your nickname into the textbox, and see the nicknames they could use.
